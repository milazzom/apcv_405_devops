# Case Study 2: DevOps Workflow, Release Management, and Deployment

## Overview
This case study focuses on the practical application of DevOps principles covered in Weeks 3 through 5: Development Workflow, Releasing and Testing, and Deploying/Packaging. You will analyze a software project scenario and propose solutions for building, releasing, testing, and deploying software using modern DevOps practices.

## Scenario
You are part of a DevOps team responsible for managing the lifecycle of a web application. The application is actively developed, frequently updated, and must be reliably built, tested, released, and deployed to production.

## Assignment Tasks

### 1. Development Workflow
- Describe how you would set up a build pipeline for this application.
- Explain how you would manage external libraries and dependencies, including strategies for upgrading them safely.
- Outline the role of compilers or build tools in your workflow.

### 2. Releasing, File Versioning, and Testing
- Propose a change management process for scheduling and managing releases.
- Detail how you would use a source code manager (e.g., GitHub) to track changes and collaborate with your team.
- Explain how you would automate functional, performance, and regression testing as part of the release process.

### 3. Deploying and Packaging
- Describe the steps to package and deploy the application to production.
- Compare different packaging methods and justify your choice for this scenario.
- Explain how you would use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and automated deployment tools to provision environments and deploy updates.

## Deliverables
- A written report (2â€“3 pages) addressing each of the tasks above.
- Diagrams or flowcharts illustrating your proposed pipeline and deployment process (optional but encouraged).
- References to tools, technologies, or best practices you recommend.

## Evaluation Criteria

All submissions will be evaluated using the following criteria:

- Depth and clarity of analysis
- Practicality and relevance of proposed solutions
- Use of DevOps principles and best practices
- Quality of written communication and organization
