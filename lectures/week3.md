## 2. Linking and Upgrading Libraries
- What are software libraries?
- Linking libraries: static vs. dynamic
- Identifying and upgrading dependencies

**Resource:**  
- [Managing Dependencies (npm)](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-dependencies-and-devdependencies)

## Suggested Reading & Practice
- Review your project's build and deployment process.
- Explore a pipeline-as-code tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
- Try upgrading a dependency in a sample project.
