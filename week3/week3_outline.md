# Week 3: Development Workflow

## Lecture Objectives
- Learn to deploy and build software.
- Understand linking to external libraries and upgrading them.
- Explore compiler usage and the concept of pipeline as code.
- Learn to build and automate development pipelines.

---

## 1. Software Deployment and Building
- What is software deployment?
- Build processes and tools (Make, Maven, Gradle, npm)
- Deployment strategies

---

## 2. Linking and Upgrading Libraries
- What are software libraries?
- Linking libraries: static vs. dynamic
- Identifying and upgrading dependencies

---

## 3. Compilers and Translation to Machine Language
- What is a compiler?
- Compilation vs. interpretation
- Common compilers (GCC, javac, etc.)

---

## 4. Pipeline as Code
- What is pipeline as code?
- Benefits of treating pipelines as code
- Example: YAML pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines)

## Suggested Reading & Practice
- Review your project's build and deployment process.
- Explore a pipeline-as-code tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
- Try upgrading a dependency in a sample project.
